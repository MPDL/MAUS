# MAUS
Machine-AUtomated Support for Software Management Plans


## About MAUS

* "MAUS" stands for "Machine-AUtomated Support for Software Management Plans" or "MAschinelle Unterstützung von Software-Management-Plänen".
* Project description - from [GEPRIS](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/543616919): <br />
  "The MAUS project promotes the use of software management plans (SMPs). The aim is to support the explicit use of research software by scientists through simple services. This is achieved through a seamless flow of information into and out of SMPs."
* MAUS is based on the open source software [RDMO](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/) (Research Data Management Organizer).


## Currently available

An example SMP is provided [here](https://github.com/lauraBahamon/de-rse-2025-demo).

Further information can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.17617/2.3637440) - these are materials for our workshop at [deRSE25](https://events.hifis.net/event/1741/). They include screencasts showing the SMP and its export to GitHub.
