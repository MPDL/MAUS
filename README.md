# MAUS
Machine-AUtomated Support for Software Management Plans


## About MAUS

* "MAUS" stands for "Machine-AUtomated Support for Software Management Plans" or "MAschinelle Unterstützung von Software-Management-Plänen".
* Project description - from [GEPRIS](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/543616919): <br />
  "The MAUS project promotes the use of software management plans (SMPs). The aim is to support the explicit use of research software by scientists through simple services. This is achieved through a seamless flow of information into and out of SMPs."
* MAUS is based on the open source software [RDMO](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/) (Research Data Management Organizer).


## Currently available

Here is our [RDMO demo instance](https://demo-rdmo.mpdl.mpg.de/) to test our plugins.

An example SMP is provided [here](https://github.com/lauraBahamon/de-rse-2025-demo).

Further information can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.17617/2.3637440) - these are materials for our workshop at [deRSE25](https://events.hifis.net/event/1741/). They include screencasts showing the SMP and its export to GitHub.


## Current topics

* Survey of the SMP-DE-Community about the usage of SMPs: [Link](https://limesurvey.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/525728)

## Repositories

* The code for our SMP-specific plugins can be found in this repository: [rdmo-plugins-maus](https://github.com/MPDL/rdmo-plugins-maus)
* And here are our forked [rdmo-plugins-github](https://github.com/MPDL/rdmo-plugins-github) and [rdmo-plugins-gitlab](https://github.com/MPDL/rdmo-plugins-gitlab) each with an extra export plugin
